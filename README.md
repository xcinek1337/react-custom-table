# React - Custom Table
![react-customizable-tabele](https://github.com/xcinek1337/react-custom-table/assets/125750465/634df96d-f892-4837-9edb-2240ceeb3786)

This project includes a table component that you can use in your own project. It is easy to implement, and you are welcome to use the code. The table is ready to display data you provide, allowing you to set the number of rows per page, decide whether to include a search function, and enable sorting by your columns.
